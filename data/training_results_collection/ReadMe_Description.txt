DESCRIPTION FOR EACH TRAINED MODEL:

/result_2001: DTL^3_3 (3 HQS iterations, 3 stages) trained with denoising tasks (w/ mixed noise levels). 
/result_2002: DTL^3_3 (3 HQS iterations, 3 stages) trained with denoising and deconvolution tasks (w/ mixed noise levels and blur kernels). 
/result_2015: DTL^5_3 (5 HQS iterations, 3 stages) trained with denoising tasks (mixed noise levels). 

note that the Matlab file 'workspace.mat' in each folder contains not only the model coefficients but also other intermediate data.
